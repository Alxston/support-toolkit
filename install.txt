= The Support Toolkit =
The Support Toolkit (STK) was developed by the phpBB.com Support Team in cooperation with EXreaction. The STK provides a second "Administration Control Panel" that can be used to recover various part of a corrupted phpBB 3.0.x installation or to solve commonly encountered problems with the software.

= Installation instructions =
To install the Support Toolkit, upload the complete "stk" directory into your forum's root directory on your server (the one containing a file named "config.php"). Once you have uploaded the directory into the correct place, point your browser towards the toolkit to access it (http://www.example.com/phpBB/stk/).
In the "contrib" folder you will find some additional installation instructions (in the MODX format) which will allow you to better integrate the STK with your phpBB installation.
